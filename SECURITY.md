# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please open a GitHub issue
or contact the repository owner directly. This is an experimental project and
does not handle sensitive data, but reports are still appreciated.

## Scope

This repository contains two self-contained, offline Python projects. Neither
project makes network requests, handles authentication, or processes untrusted
input in production. The HTML dashboards are intended for local viewing only.
